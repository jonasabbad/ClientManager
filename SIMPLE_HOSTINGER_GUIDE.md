## PART 5: UPLOAD YOUR FILES

### Step 11: Upload Files to VPS

**Option A: Using FileZilla (Recommended)**
1. Download FileZilla from: https://filezilla-project.org/
2. Open FileZilla
3. Fill in at the top:
   - Host: `sftp://123.45.67.89` (your VPS IP)
   - Username: `root`
   - Password: your VPS password
   - Port: `22`
4. Click "Quickconnect"
5. On the right side (Remote site), navigate to: `/var/www/`
6. Right-click and create folder: `customer-management`
7. Enter that folder
8. On the left side (Local site), navigate to your extracted project folder
9. Select ALL files and drag them to the right side
10. Wait for upload to complete (5-10 minutes)

**Option B: Using SCP (Advanced)**
From your local computer terminal:
```bash
scp -r /path/to/your/project root@123.45.67.89:/var/www/customer-management
```

## PART 6: CONFIGURE YOUR APP

### Step 12: Go to Your App Folder
In your VPS SSH terminal:
```bash
cd /var/www/customer-management
```

### Step 13: Create .env File
```bash
nano .env
```

Copy and paste this (CHANGE the password to what you used in Step 10):
```
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=5000
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://dbuser:YourStrongPassword123@localhost:5432/customer_management
PGHOST=localhost
PGPORT=5432
PGUSER=dbuser
PGPASSWORD=YourStrongPassword123
PGDATABASE=customer_management
SESSION_SECRET=change-this-to-any-random-long-string-12345
```

Press `Ctrl + X`, then `Y`, then `Enter` to save.

### Step 14: Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```
Wait 3-5 minutes.

### Step 15: Build the App
```bash
npm run build
```
Wait 1-2 minutes.

### Step 16: Setup Database Tables
```bash
npm run db:push
```

## PART 7: START YOUR APP

### Step 17: Start with PM2
```bash
pm2 start ecosystem.config.cjs
```

Check if it's running:
```bash
pm2 list
```

You should see "online" status.

Check if app responds:
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000
```

You should see HTML code.

### Step 18: Save PM2 Config
```bash
pm2 save
pm2 startup systemd
```

Copy the command it shows and run it.

## PART 8: CONFIGURE NGINX

### Step 19: Create Nginx Config
```bash
nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/customer-management
```

Copy and paste this (REPLACE `yourdomain.com` with YOUR domain):
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name yourdomain.com www.yourdomain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:5000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

**If you don't have a domain yet**, use your IP address:
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name 123.45.67.89;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:5000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
}
```

Press `Ctrl + X`, then `Y`, then `Enter`.

### Step 20: Enable Site
```bash
ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/customer-management /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
```

### Step 21: Test and Restart Nginx
```bash
nginx -t
```

Should say "test is successful".

```bash
systemctl restart nginx
```

## PART 9: TEST YOUR WEBSITE

### Step 22: Visit Your Website
Open your browser and go to:
