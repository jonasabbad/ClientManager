Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Technology Stack:**
- **Framework:** React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool:** Vite for fast development and optimized production builds
- **Routing:** Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **State Management:** TanStack React Query for server state management
- **UI Framework:** shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- **Forms:** React Hook Form with Zod validation

**Design Philosophy:**
- Inspired by Linear, Notion, and Stripe Dashboard aesthetics
- Information clarity over decoration
- Consistent interaction patterns
- Efficient screen real estate usage
- Typography: Inter font family with JetBrains Mono for code
- Responsive grid layouts with mobile-first approach
- Dark/light theme support with ThemeProvider

**Key UI Components:**
- Client cards with service badges and code displays
- Dashboard with statistics and activity feed
- Dialog-based forms for adding/editing clients
- Print functionality for thermal (80mm) and A4 formats using jsPDF

### Backend Architecture

**Server Framework:**
- Express.js with TypeScript (minimal backend for static file serving)
- ESM module system
- Vite middleware integration for development

**Data Operations:**
- **All data operations now handled client-side using Firebase Web SDK**
- No backend API routes for data operations
- Direct Firestore access from browser using Firebase Web SDK
- TanStack React Query for client-side state management and caching

**Data Validation:**
- Zod schemas for runtime type validation
- Shared schema definitions in `shared/schema.ts`
- Client schema enforces required fields and validation
- Service type enum: `inwi | orange | maroc-telecom | water | gas | electricity`

**Development Features:**
- Vite middleware integration for HMR
- Firebase Web SDK initialization in `client/src/lib/firebase.ts`
- Firestore service layer in `client/src/lib/firestoreService.ts`

### Data Storage

**Database:**
- Firebase Firestore (NoSQL cloud database)
- Firebase Web SDK (client-side) for browser operations
- Real-time updates and offline support
- Serverless and globally distributed

**Firebase Configuration:**
- API Key: AIzaSyBiuVZzpqPMP-Q_76aGifJHKWknEU4Jr9o
- Project ID: customer-management-34f78
- App ID: 1:207346074611:web:1e860799194881ee594886
- **NOTE:** Firestore security rules must be configured in Firebase Console

**Collections:**
- **Clients Collection:**
  - `id` (string, document ID)
  - `name` (string, required)
  - `phone` (string, required)
  - `codes` (array of service/code objects)
  - `createdAt` (timestamp)
  - `updatedAt` (timestamp)

- **Activities Collection:**
  - `id` (string, document ID)
  - `type` (string: created, updated, deleted)
  - `clientId` (number)
  - `clientName` (string)
  - `description` (string)
  - `createdAt` (timestamp)

- **Service Codes Collection:**
  - `id` (string, document ID)
  - `serviceType` (string)
  - `displayName` (string)
  - `isActive` (number: 0 or 1)
  - `createdAt` (timestamp)
  - `updatedAt` (timestamp)

**Data Access Pattern:**
- Service layer pattern via firestoreService
- All CRUD operations in `client/src/lib/firestoreService.ts`:
  - `getAllClients()` - Fetch all clients
  - `getClientById(id)` - Fetch single client  
  - `createClient(data)` - Create new client
  - `updateClient(id, data)` - Update existing client
  - `deleteClient(id)` - Delete client
  - `getStatistics()` - Calculate dashboard statistics
- Search functionality implemented client-side
- Searches across name, phone, and code values
- Statistics aggregation using Firestore queries

**Type System:**
- `FirestoreClient` type with `createdAt: string` and `updatedAt?: string`
- All components migrated to use FirestoreClient instead of Client
- Query keys use direct service names ("clients", "statistics") instead of API paths

**Deployment Strategy:**
- Static site deployment to Vercel or any hosting platform
- Frontend: Static HTML/JS/CSS files
- No backend API required - direct Firebase connection from browser
- Database: Firebase Firestore (cloud NoSQL)
- Firebase credentials embedded in frontend config (public API key)
- **Security handled via Firestore security rules in Firebase Console**
- Schema defined in `shared/schema.ts` for type sharing
